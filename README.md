## Learn How to Work with Numbers and Strings by Recreating the Luhn Algorithm for Credit Card Validity

Learning how to work with numbers and strings in Python through string manipulation and numerical computations. The Luhn Algorithm is a commonly used method for error-checking a credit card's validity. 

The algorithm states:
1. From the right to left, double the value of every second digit; if the product is greater than 9, sum the digits of the products.
2. Take the sum of all the digits.
3. If the sum of all the digits is a multiple of 10, then the number is valid; else it is not valid.
